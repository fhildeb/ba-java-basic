HSMW BA Java Course for Beginners from the University of Applied Science Mittweida that took place in 2017.

> **_NOTE:_** The code commentary, folders, and filenames might appear in German.

## Course Content

The course covered fundamental computer science concepts and programming techniques, as it was the primary language during my bachelor's study. It covered an in-depth look at software, hardware, and how higher programming languages like Java can leverage different memory models. Regarding the theoretical language itself, the different scopes of the course can be seen below. The various projects implement the learned topics and also cover libraries like JavaFX for graphical interfaces.

- Java Memory Model and Data Types
- Operators and Control Structures in Java
- Local Variables, Fields, and Arrays
- Object and Class Methods
- Namespaces and Packages
- String Manipulation and Type Casting
- Visibility Modifiers and Recursion
- Inheritance and Class Hierarchies
- Single vs. Multiple Inheritance
- Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
- Interfaces and Delegation
- Unsigned and Signed Number Computation
- The Two's Complement and Bit Operators
- Representation of Floating-Point Numbers
- Algorithm, Program, and Binary Coding Concepts
- UML Class Representation and Attribute Agreement
