> **_NOTE:_** The commentary and filenames might appear in German.

## Course Content

The course covered fundamental computer science concepts and programming techniques, as it was the primary language during my bachelor's study. It covered an in-depth look at software, hardware, and how higher programming languages like Java can leverage different memory models. Regarding the theoretical language itself, the different scopes of the course can be seen below. The various projects implement the learned topics and also cover libraries like JavaFX for graphical interfaces.

- Java Memory Model and Data Types
- Operators and Control Structures in Java
- Local Variables, Fields, and Arrays
- Object and Class Methods
- Namespaces and Packages
